- ⚡ Fun fact: The first computer bug was literally a bug—a moth found stuck in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer in 1947. The term "bug" in computing has 
                 been used ever since to describe errors in code. Grace Hopper, a pioneering computer scientist, taped the moth into her logbook.
